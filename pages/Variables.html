        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>The containers for storing data values.</p>
        
        <h2>Identifiers</h2>
        <p>JavaScript variables should be identified with unique names.</p>
        <p>These unique names are also known as identifiers.</p>
        <p>It can be short names like x and y or more descriptive like name, age, speed, etc.</p>
        <p>General Rules for Constructing names for variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can contain letters, underscores, dollar signs, and digits.</li>
            <li>It must begin with a letter.</li>
            <li>It can also begin with dollar sign ($) and underscore (_)</li>
        <li>It is case sensitive (variable x and X are different from each other)</li>
            <li>Reserved words cannot be used as a names.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Assignment Operator</h2>
        <p>The equal sign (=) is the assignment operator and not an "equal to" operator.
        <br>Example: x = i + 1;</p>
        <p>The double equal sign (==) is considered as the "equal to" operator.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <p>It can hold numbers like 100 and also text values.</p>
        <p>Text values are called text strings.</p>
        <p>JScript can handle many data types. It is written inside the double or sign quotes. Number are written without using quotes. If you insert a number in quotes, it will be considered as a text string.
        <br>Example: <br>var qw = 123;<br>
        var name = "John";<br>
        var age = "13";</p>
        
        <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
        <p>Declare a variable in JavaScript by using the keyword var.
        <br>Example: var x;
        <p>Assigning a value to the varaible by using the = sign.<br>
        x = 10;</p>
        
        <h2>Value = Undefined</h2>
        <p>Variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.</p>
        
        <h2>Re-Declaring Variables</h2>
        <p>Re-declaraing a JavaScript varaibles will not lose it's value.</p>
        
        <h2>Arithmetic</h2>
        <p>You can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables by using the operators like = and *;
        <br>Example: var i = 1 + 2 + 3;</p>
