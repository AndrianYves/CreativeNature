      HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it is the skeleton of your website.<br>  It is primarily used for designing purposes in web pages and web application.<br> HTML can be very forgiving in the making of the structure. A HTML file should <br> always have &lt;html&gt; and an end tag of &lt;/html&gt; to avoid problems and it should have <br>an extension of .html.
